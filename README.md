# BoycoT Steam Game Launcher
On the first launch, it will check all disks for SteamLibrary folders. It will hit the Steam API to get the images and render a button for each discovered installed games. The icons will be stored locally and be used instead of hitting the API again. If a new game is installed, it will hit the API to get the image and store it locally.
